# Analysis of data for the manuscript "Gluten-free diet promotes small-scale changes in multiple T-cell subsets in NOD mice"

 This repository contains an analysis of the single-cell RNA sequencing of tissues from NOD mice on gluten free diet (GFD) and mice on standard diet (STD). The analysis has three main parts:
- Part 1: Analysis of scRNAseq data 
- Part 2: Analysis of flow cytometry data


Raw sequencing data were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive [PRJNA1157582](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1157582/).
